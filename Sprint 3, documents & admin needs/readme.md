We have provided two class diagrams to illustrate the design and structure of the Fiery Dragons game. Each diagram has its strengths and limitations, and we hope this message helps clarify our intention and the rationale behind these choices.

Diagram 1: PlantUML (with Packaging)

Description: This diagram includes comprehensive packaging to depict the organization of classes within their respective packages. It offers a detailed and granular view of the entire class structure, ensuring every class and its relationships are clearly defined.
Limitations: Due to the extensive detail and plantuml limits, the diagram may appear cluttered and harder to navigate.

Diagram 2: Mermaid.js (Clean Layout)

Description: This diagram provides a clean and easily readable layout. It focuses on presenting the core classes and their relationships, making it straightforward to understand the overall structure and interactions.
Limitations: While it is less cluttered, it lacks packaging details and some features present in the PlantUML diagram.

Disclaimer and Request

We recognize that each diagram has its trade-offs. The PlantUML diagram's detailed nature may appear overwhelming, but it accurately reflects the full scope and intricacies of our codebase. The Mermaid.js diagram, though more aesthetically pleasing and easier to read, omits certain structural elements.

We kindly ask you to consider both diagrams together when assessing our project. Our goal was to balance detail and clarity, providing a comprehensive yet accessible view of our software design.

We appreciate your understanding and hope that you will evaluate our work objectively, acknowledging the effort and thought put into accurately representing our project's architecture. Regarding the CRCs, it should be fine and viewable without issues.
